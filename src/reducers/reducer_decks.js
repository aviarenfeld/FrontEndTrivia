        {q: 'Explain Lexical Scoping', a: 'Lexical Scoping describes how a parser resolves variable names when functions are nested. \nThe word "lexical" refers to the fact that lexical scoping uses the location where a variable is declared within the source code to determine where that variable is available. \nE.G. Nested functions have access to variables declared in their outer scope.'

The HTML 5 <! doctype html> is recognized by all modern browsers.'
				},
				{q: 'How you can Use Modernizr in HTML 5?', a: 'Modernizr is an open source JavaScript library that helps to detect features of HTML5 and CSS3. The good thing about the Modernizr JS is that we can download this depending on the requirements.

That JavaScript file will contain only the source code for the selected features.'
				},
				{q: 'What are HTML5 Semantic Elements?', a: 'HTML5 introduced elements with a meaning. A Semantic Element helps the developer and the browser to understand its meaning. There are two types of Semantic Elements: 1.Semantic: These elements clearly define their content like <form>, <img>, <table> and so on. 2. Non-semantic: These elements have no definition, they dont define anything about their content like <span> and <div>.'
				},
				{q: 'What is the advantage of collapsing white space?', a: 'White spaces are blank sequence of space characters, which is actually treated as a single space character in html.

This enables you to organize the html code into a much more readable format.'

Those that don’t have a mouse cursor over that link is considered a normal link.'
				},
				{q: 'Can I specify fractional weight values such as 670 or 973 for font weight?', a: 'Implementation largely depends on the browser, but the standard does not support fractional weight values. Acceptable values must end with two zeroes.'
				},
				{q: 'What is the hierarchy that is being followed when it comes to style sheets?', a: 'If a single selector includes three different style definitions, the definition that is closest to the actual tag takes precedence. Inline style takes priority over embedded style sheets, which takes priority over external style sheets.'
				},
				{q: 'Can several selectors with class names be grouped together?', a: 'You can define several selectors with the same style definition by separating them with commas. This same technique also works for selectors with class names.'
				},
				{q: 'What happens if you open the external CSS file in a browser?', a: 'If you try to open the external CSS file in a browser, the browser cannot open the file, because the file has a different extension. The only way to use an external CSS file is to reference it using <link/> tag within another html document.'
				},
				{q: 'What happens if the number of values in the rows or cols attribute doesn’t add up to 100 percent?', a: 'The browser sizes the frames relative to the total sum of the values.
